# OpenDataWithR

Goals:
•	Design and implement a logistic regression model to study correlation between factors crucial to malignancy of tumorous mass
•	Analyz and visualize breast cancer diagnostic dataset provided by UC Irvine database using R packages

Analysis of Diagnostic Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

It is set of data generated from digitalized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, to determine whether the mass is malignant or benign. Using the cell nucleus present in the images, real-valued characteristics were computed.

Data Dictionary:
There are 10 different variables that are used in this dataset for each #id and the diagnosed result of M: Malignant or B: Benign breast mass test sample.
1.	Radius – which is the mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter of each cell nucleus
2.	Texture – if the standard deviation of grey-scale values of the image
3.	Perimeter – value for each cell nucleus captured in the image
4.	Area
5.	Smoothness – gives local variation in the lengths of the radii
6.	Compactness – is given by the formula: (perimeter^2/area -1.0) 
7.	Concavity – gives severity of concave portions of the contour
8.	Concave points – Number of concave portions of the contour 
9.	Symmetry
10.	Fractal dimension – gives the coastline approximation minus 1.0
